# MinerScript
Shell script to start a miner for ZCoin on Suprnova

#Usage
You will need a working cpuminer; get from Ocminer's repo:
https://github.com/ocminer/cpuminer-xzc

This script is for mining on the Suprnova pool. You can modify the script to mine on any other pool you want.
Make sure you change the path to the cpuminer script to reflect the location on your system.

Make the script executable:
```
chmod +x ./cpuminer.sh
```

#Disclaimer
I wrote this simple script to help me run my miner with a single-click rather than having to manually open the terminal and typing it out myself.
It might not work perfectly for you.
